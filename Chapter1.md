## **Chapter 1**


### **Day 1**



**1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.**

Blockchain is a decentralized, public network where every transaction and contracts are seen by everyone who has access to it.

**2. Explain what a Smart Contract is**

A smart contracts are a set of instructions that if implemented, could send something to another individual or account.


**3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**

Scripts are merely just codes of programming whilst a transaction is where the actual money is involved. 

### Day 2 

**1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**

Safety and Security, Clarifty, Approachability, Developer Experience, and Resource Oriented Programming.

**2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?**

From what I could understand, I believe that the 5 pillars could be useful in many malicious situations. It's easy (in some sense) to learn and understand since it's rather an approachable language and moderately pleasing to the eyes while you are examining your code, hence the clarity. Failures in using the code can be a great mentor since you can build up the experience to not mess up again and there's just an assurance that Cadence is just a secure programming language.
