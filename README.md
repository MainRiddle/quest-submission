## Chapter 1


### Day 1

1. Blockchain is a decentralized, public network where every transaction and contracts are seen by everyone who has access to it.
2. A smart contracts are a set of instructions that if implemented, could send something to another individual or account.
3. Scripts are merely just codes of programming whilst a transaction is where the actual money is involved. 

### Day 2 

1. Safety and Security, Clarifty, Approachability, Developer Experience, and Resource Oriented Programming.
2. From what I could understand, I believe that the 5 pillars could be useful in many malicious situations. It's easy (in some sense) to learn and understand since it's rather an approachable language and moderately pleasing to the eyes while you are examining your code, hence the clarity. Failures in using the code can be a great mentor since you can build up the experience to not mess up again and there's just an assurance that Cadence is just a secure programming language.
